# Class Activity: Build Demo JDBC Application with DAO

## Goal:
The main goal of the activity is to teach students how to use a DAO pattern to perform CRUD operations in a JDBC application. By implementing a DAO class and using it in a Main class to perform CRUD operations, students will learn the following:
- The purpose and benefits of using the DAO pattern in a JDBC application.
- How to create a DAO class that includes methods for performing CRUD operations.
- How to use the DAO class to interact with a database.

## Requirements:
1. Batch has an understanding of the DAO pattern and how it is used to organize the database access code in a JDBC application.
2. Run tests on VSCode or Intellij (click test runner and run on VSCode, open test/java/JdbcTest and run on Intellij)

## Instructions:
1. Divide the class into groups of 2-3 students.
2. Have each group fork the activy repo -> open locally -> follow instrustions in Jdbc.java
3. Tell students how many tests out of the total they should complete with the time you provide (I recommend 2 per 60min)
4. Give the groups time to work on the activity and provide assistance as needed.
5. Once the groups have completed the activity, rank them by time and accuracy.
6. Demo/Explain any concept the class struggled with. 
7. Finally, provide a summary of the main takeaways from the activity and how the DAO pattern can be used in real-world applications.

## Note:
- It's important to note that DAO pattern is a best practice to organize the code that interacts with the database, it helps to separate the database access code from the rest of the application and to have a better control of the resources.
- Also, it's important to have the proper JDBC driver, the database and the credentials to connect it, also it's important to have a basic understanding of SQL.

## Deliverables:
- 2/6 tests in 60min

## Evaluation Criteria:
- Proper implementation of the DAO pattern
- Proper use of the ConnectionFactory class
- Proper implementation of CRUD operations
- Code quality and organization
- Presentation and demonstration of the demo application
